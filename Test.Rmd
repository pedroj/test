When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
motif <- read.table(file.choose())
motif <- read.table("VSS_IM.txt",header=TRUE,sep="\t",dec=".")
summary(motif)
attach(motif)

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(plant.height~nectar.rew)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
